# Amos Single File Libraries

A collection of useful libraries that I commonly use in projects, made into single file libraries. They are released under the MIT license. You may use everything free, though attribution is appreciated. They are offered without warranty or guarantees. Some of these libraries are not mine, but ones I find useful. Check individual libraries for licenses.

# Libraries

The libraries are used as-is. They aren't really stand-alone as such, more they are the base functionality I tend to bring along into every project I work on.
