# Amos Single File Libraries

A collection of useful libraries that I commonly use in projects, made into single file libraries. They are relesed under the MIT license. You may use everything free, though attribution is appreciated. They are offered without warranty or garuntees. Some of these libraries are not mine, but ones I find useful. Check individual libraries for licenses.
