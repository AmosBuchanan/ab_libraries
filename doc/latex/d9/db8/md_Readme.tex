A collection of useful libraries that I commonly use in projects, made into single file libraries. They are released under the M\+IT license. You may use everything free, though attribution is appreciated. They are offered without warranty or guarantees. Some of these libraries are not mine, but ones I find useful. Check individual libraries for licenses.
